      SecurePass-TypeAuthn analyzes the rhythm of your typing to build a private behavioral
      biometric profile. Every key press and pause becomes part of a transparent, secure
      authentication story.
    </p>

    <p class="section-description">
      Get started below by first creating your profile and then testing the authentication
      experience. Each area explains what to expect so you can type naturally and confidently.

          Record three guided typing samples so the model can learn your dwell, flight, and
          pause patterns. We'll only keep anonymized timing data on your device.

        <p>
          Verify your identity with a short phrase challenge, review the confidence score,
          and unlock your time-based one-time password when the match succeeds.
